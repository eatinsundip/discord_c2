Steps to start:

pip install the discord library into your environment.

setup a discord bot at: https://discord.com/developers/applications/

Use your token under the token variable.

Either use or remove the userid field. 

I would recomend using it so everyone on discord that may have access to the bot can't execute code themselves.

Talk I gave on this at a secdsm meeting.

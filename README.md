Steps to start:

pip install the discord library into your environment.
setup a dicord bot at: https://discord.com/developers/applications/
Use your token under the token variable.
Either use or remove the userid field. 
I would recomend using it so everyone on discord that may have access to the bot can't execute code themselves.
